        <p>What if we don't want the padding and border to be added on top of the width, 
          but rather be included in the total width calculation? We can accomplish this 
          by setting the box-sizing property to border-box. Do this for the second box and 
          note the results. Note how the content box has shrunken to allow room for the padding and 
          border. NB: The default value for the box-sizing property is content-box</p>
